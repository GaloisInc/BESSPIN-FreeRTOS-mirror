/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates all the demo application tasks and software timers, then
 * starts the scheduler.  The web documentation provides more details of the
 * standard demo application tasks, which provide no particular functionality,
 * but do provide a good example of how to use the FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill both the core registers with known values, then
 * check that each register maintains its expected value for the lifetime of the
 * task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg test tasks execute
 * with a very low priority, so get preempted very frequently.  A register
 * containing an unexpected value is indicative of an error in the context
 * switching mechanism.
 *
 * "Check" task - The check executes every three seconds.  It checks that all
 * the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks, are not only still
 * executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If the check task
 * discovers that a task has either stalled, or reported an error, then it
 * prints an error message to the UART, otherwise it prints "Pass.".
